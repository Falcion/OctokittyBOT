**Welcome to the Stagnum bot documentation!**

**Stagnum** is a bot that allows you to search for information about a GitHub service through the Discord app. With the help of special commands, he is capable of:

1. Making simple information requests about the GitHub service about such "objects" as: repositories, commits, releases, etc.
2. Creation of informational-massive requests for the GitHub service that return an array of certain "objects", such as: an array of releases, a repository, an array of commits, etc.
3. Create search queries within the GitHub service that search for specific "objects" using specific and only specified filters. These search queries are distinguished by their complexity and the fact that they contain an advanced level of arguments.
